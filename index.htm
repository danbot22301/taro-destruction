<h1>The Art of Destruction</h1>
<h2>Finding Beauty in a Mess</h2>


<p>
Something seemingly very important to pet birds is making sure to leave their mark on everything around them, whether that be be biting, sctraching, or otherwise damaging 
the things near to them. As frustrating as this may be to their owners, domesticated birds need to do this in order to keep their beaks at a healthy length, and in a shape 
that allows them to eat properly. Therefore, when put into the position of household parakeet, it is actually in one's best interests to go out of their way to chew on 
<i>everything</i> nearby. As for the other forms of destruction mentioned, those seem to be more alligned with spite than practicality, and likely indicate boredom, or displeasure
with something in their environment.
